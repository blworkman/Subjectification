SUMMARY
=======
This is a project I wrote for my Posthuman Media Studies class in my senior year of college. We were tasked with making an artistic
representation of Facebook's "subjectification" of our identity. For each user, Facebook keeps track of certain targeted ad words that
it associates with that individual account. It uses these words to build a representation, or subjectification, of what it thinks that
that user is like as a person. With this information, Facebook is able to personally target ads to each user. Sometimes these targeted
ad words paint a picture of a person who is drastically different from the actual user. In this way, Facebook's system is imperfect. We
were tasked to bring this person alive through artistic representation. For my project, I decided to make a simple point and click game
set in the bedroom of my old apartment. The player can use a flashlight to explore the room, and some parts of the room are able to be
clicked on. Optionally, the program can support voice inputs through Google Chrome's voice-to-text API. This part of the code that 
interacts with Chome's API was written by Florian Shulz.

TO RUN

The code in this program is compatible with Processing version 3.2.1. Information on how to run the voice-to-text portion is located at 
the start of webserv.pde.
